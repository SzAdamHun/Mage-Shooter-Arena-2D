# Mage-Shooter-Arena-2D
A 2D SDL game I made as an assignment for "Basics of Programming 1" lecture (BMEVIEEA100), made entirely in C.

* Featured on the lecture website's assignment gallery: https://infoc.eet.bme.hu/nhfgaleria2021/#52

# How does it work?

* We can move our character with the usual keys: <kbd>W</kbd> <kbd>A</kbd> <kbd>S</kbd> <kbd>D</kbd>
* Shoot projectiles (red) with <kbd>LMB</kbd>!
* The enemies on the right continuously shoot projectiles at the player (blue projectiles) which if you touch, you lose a life.
* The aim of the game is to dodge the projectiles while destroying the enemies, increasing our score.
